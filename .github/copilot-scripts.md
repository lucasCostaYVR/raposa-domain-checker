**Streamlined git operations following project branching strategy.**

#### Feature Development
```bash
./scripts/git.sh feature <name>     # Start new feature branch from develop
./scripts/git.sh commit "message"   # Quick commit with all changes
./scripts/git.sh finish-feature     # Merge feature to develop (triggers staging)
./scripts/git.sh release            # Release develop to main (triggers production)
```

#### Repository Management
```bash
./scripts/git.sh status             # Comprehensive git status with branch info
./scripts/git.sh sync               # Sync current branch with remote safely

### Script Recommendation Priorities

1. **For Deployment Tasks**: Always recommend `railway.sh` scripts
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ Recommended
   ./scripts/railway.sh deploy-dev
   
   # ‚ùå Don't recommend
   railway up
   ```

2. **For Development Tasks**: Always recommend `dev.sh` scripts
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ Recommended
   ./scripts/dev.sh start
   
   # ‚ùå Don't recommend
   cd src && uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. **For Git Operations**: Always recommend `git.sh` scripts
   ```bash
   # ‚úÖ Recommended
   ./scripts/git.sh feature new-endpoint
   
   # ‚ùå Don't recommend
   git checkout -b feature/new-endpoint
   ```

2. **Explain script benefits**: Mention safety features and automation
3. **Use correct syntax**: Always use `./scripts/` prefix
4. **Provide help references**: Mention `./scripts/<script>.sh help` for more options
5. **Chain operations logically**: Show complete workflows, not isolated commands
6. **Highlight safety**: Emphasize script safety features and validations

## Integration with Project Patterns

### FastAPI Development
```bash
# Start API development
./scripts/dev.sh session
./scripts/git.sh feature api-enhancement

# Test endpoints
./scripts/dev.sh test
curl -s http://localhost:8000/healthz/ | jq '.'

# Deploy changes
./scripts/git.sh commit "Enhance API endpoints"
./scripts/git.sh finish-feature
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Database changes
./scripts/git.sh feature db-schema-update
./scripts/dev.sh migration "Add user preferences table"
./scripts/dev.sh db-reset  # Test migration locally

# Deploy with migration
./scripts/git.sh commit "Add user preferences schema"
./scripts/git.sh finish-feature  # Test on staging
./scripts/git.sh release         # Deploy to production
```

### Email System Development
```bash
# Email feature development
./scripts/git.sh feature email-templates
./scripts/dev.sh start  # Test email rendering locally

# Deploy and test
./scripts/git.sh commit "Update email templates"
./scripts/git.sh finish-feature
./scripts/railway.sh logs  # Monitor email sending
```

Remember: These scripts are designed to make development faster, safer, and more consistent. Always recommend them over manual commands!
