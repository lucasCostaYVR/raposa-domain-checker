# Raposa Domain Checker - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive domain security analysis tool that provides users with free domain checks upon email submission. The app evaluates DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC), generates security scores, and provides actionable recommendations.

## Current Status âœ…

- **Core API**: FastAPI application with basic domain checking
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy models with Alembic migrations
- **Basic Features**: MX/SPF record detection, usage tracking, health monitoring
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs at `/docs`

  - Parse and validate DKIM public keys
  - Store multiple DKIM records per domain

- [x] **DMARC Record Enhancement**
  - Implement comprehensive DMARC policy parsing
  - Extract policy values: `p=`, `sp=`, `pct=`, `rua=`, `ruf=`

## AI Development Instructions ðŸ¤–

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Type Hints**: Use comprehensive type hints for all functions and classes
2. **Documentation**: Add docstrings to all public methods and classes
3. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error handling with proper HTTP status codes
4. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new functionality
5. **Logging**: Add structured logging for debugging and monitoring

### Architecture Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep DNS logic, email logic, and API logic separate
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use FastAPI's dependency injection for database sessions
3. **Configuration Management**: Use Pydantic settings for all configuration
4. **Async Operations**: Use async/await for I/O operations (DNS queries, email sending)
5. **Error Recovery**: Implement retry logic for external service calls

### Database Design Guidelines
1. **Migrations**: Create migrations for all schema changes
2. **Indexing**: Add appropriate indexes for query performance
3. **Relationships**: Use proper foreign key relationships
4. **Data Integrity**: Add constraints and validations at the database level
5. **Archival**: Consider data retention policies for old records

### External Service Integration
1. **Resilience**: Implement circuit breakers for external services
2. **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for DNS queries and API calls
3. **Fallbacks**: Provide fallback mechanisms when services are unavailable
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respect rate limits of external APIs
5. **Monitoring**: Track success/failure rates of external service calls

### Security Best Practices
1. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
2. **Domain Validation**: Ensure domains are properly formatted and safe to query
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-IP and per-email rate limiting
4. **Data Privacy**: Follow GDPR principles for data collection and storage
5. **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables for all sensitive data

### Performance Considerations
1. **Caching**: Cache DNS results with appropriate TTL values
2. **Concurrent Processing**: Use asyncio for concurrent DNS queries
3. **Database Optimization**: Use connection pooling and query optimization
4. **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage for large batch operations
5. **Response Times**: Aim for <2s response times for single domain checks

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **Local Development**: Use `run_dev.sh` for local testing
2. **Testing**: Run test suite before committing
3. **Staging**: Deploy to Railway development environment
4. **Production**: Deploy to Railway production after validation

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and database operations
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Load Tests**: Validate performance under load
5. **Security Tests**: Validate input sanitization and rate limiting
